            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XIBYPryTpXA-J1fk5fL3Hg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Happy New Year and Happy Lunar New Year! We’ve been hard at work building up the art for our Legends Deck, the tech for the Legends NFTs, and a few other things. We’re very excited to share them with you—let’s take a look! 👀👇</p><h3>Transaction History With CAP 👑</h3><p>The Legends Series is now integrated with <a href="http://cap.ooo">CAP</a>! From now on, you will be able to find every mint, sale and transfer that’s occurred for any Legend NFT.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xiG_ifQAa5UntX_Gil_KHA.png" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the <a href="http://explorer.cap.ooo">Cap explorer</a>, where you can now <strong><em>explore</em></strong><em> the history of legends NFTs.</em></figcaption></figure><p>We worked closely with <a href="https://medium.com/u/8c9c237f4544">PsychedelicDAO</a> (the awesome team behind CAP and other great projects) to help them get their Motoko SDK ready. As a result of that effort, you will see CAP rolling out to many other projects on the IC, too. Saga supporters, take pride in helping drive this ecosystem development! Together, wagmi!</p><p><em>The CAP explorer isn’t showing price data yet!</em> But that’s just because we put our heads together with the <a href="https://medium.com/u/30dc82768522">btcflower</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/8c9c237f4544">PsychedelicDAO</a> teams and came up with a brand-spankin’-new✨ data interface. The UI will be updated to show that price data soon. 🧗‍♂️</p><h3>Marketplace 🏪</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tamo-vw5_jQ3xoe3q8ZEdg.png" /><figcaption>Head over to our marketplace page if you want to buy legends from other collectors!</figcaption></figure><p>Legends are on <a href="https://entrepot.app/marketplace/saga">Entrepot</a>! If you missed out on the public sale for <em>The Fool</em>, you can now collect one from that secondary marketplace. We ❤️ <a href="https://medium.com/u/c12516a945b8">Toniq Labs</a>, and are so stoked to be in their marketplace. It was very exciting 🤩 to watch everyone list their Legends and see the floor price climb to 7 ICP before settling where it is now, just above 6 ICP. 🚀</p><p>You might have noticed that some of our marketplace stats and past transactions list are busted, though… 😵‍💫😬 Sorry! The fix is known to us, and we appreciate patience while we work through our overflowing TODO list! 🙏</p><h3>Tarot Table App 🃏✨</h3><p>In January we dropped some full tarot card decks to Legends holders, and a little app to use those decks in. Say hello to the <a href="http://table.saga.cards">Tarot Table alpha release</a>! It’s a little app that will allow you to do readings if you already know your way around a tarot deck.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F672870604%3Fh%3Dda7885954c%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F672870604&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1363571270-2562728c9b5c3bf68c05cc55c5797776f7296b106399eafb87b0e148f000bb16-d_295x166&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="576" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/d1857a57ffddff704172e80525056299/href">https://medium.com/media/d1857a57ffddff704172e80525056299/href</a></iframe><p>If you don’t have your own deck, you can still use the app with the default deck. Building this app was a ton of fun, and we’re looking forward to building it up. We want to take some time each month to build tarot dApps and experiences like this one that allow holders to utilize their decks to do real tarot!</p><p>P.S. If you want to get your hands on <a href="https://6e6eb-piaaa-aaaaj-qal6a-cai.raw.ic0.app/?tokenid=5acle-aikor-uwiaa-aaaaa-cmac7-qaqca-aaaac-q">a chaos deck</a>, tweet us <a href="http://twitter.com/sagacards">@sagacards</a> and we’ll hook you up while supplies last.</p><h3>Discord Community</h3><p>We’ve started sending out invitations to hand-picked individuals to start building up our community! We are going to be very intentional about how we get the ball rolling, and we’re looking forward to swinging the doors open wide once we feel the community is on good footing.</p><h3>Better Transaction Tech</h3><p>We fixed a few quirks in the backend of our minter, so we’re looking forward to an even smoother event with our release of <a href="https://posts.saga.cards/drop-details-legend-1-the-magician-ebf5db03997f"><em>The Magician</em></a>.</p><p>Whoa, does anyone else feel like that’s a lot of updates for a tiny team in a brand new ecosystem? Thanks to everyone who contributed in recent months. We can’t wait to keep releasing cool stuff in 2022!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e7f7ecb761ab" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://posts.saga.cards/saga-february-devlog-e7f7ecb761ab">👨‍💻🃏 Saga February Devlog</a> was originally published in <a href="https://posts.saga.cards">Saga Cards</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: I’m an independent developer and have no affiliation with Toniq Labs or Stoic Wallet.</em></p><p>If you hold Internet Computer NFTs in your Stoic Wallet, you might notice that occasionally they don’t show up. This can be the case for many newer NFT projects, where Stoic Wallet has not yet completed an integration. In these instances, you can manually add your NFTs to get them to appear in your wallet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l0dBAMO2oqDRCl7fk2BHyQ.png" /></figure><p>As of this writing, you do this using the “+” button at the top of your wallet, pictured above. This will bring up a text input field, where you can input either a canister id, or a token id. Once you add a canister or a token from a particular canister, your Stoic Wallet should then discover any NFTs from that canister from that moment on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FDUUd65cuT1coHFGn2mp0A.png" /><figcaption>Use the canister id “cwu5z-wyaaa-aaaaj-qaoaq-cai” to add <strong>Saga Legends: The Magician </strong>to your wallet.</figcaption></figure><p>You’re done! You should see your NFTs in your wallet. If you don’t know how to find your canister or token id, take a look at its URL:</p><p><a href="https://cwu5z-wyaaa-aaaaj-qaoaq-cai.raw.ic0.app/0?type=thumbnail&amp;tokenid=spj3g-4ikor-uwiaa-aaaaa-cmacg-aaqca-aaaaa-a">https://cwu5z-wyaaa-aaaaj-qaoaq-cai.raw.ic0.app/0?type=thumbnail&amp;tokenid=spj3g-4ikor-uwiaa-aaaaa-cmacg-aaqca-aaaaa-a</a></p><p>The part before .raw.ic0.app is the canister id, and the part after tokenid= is your token id. So if you want to add your <em>Series #0 The Fool</em>, use the canister id “nges7-giaaa-aaaaj-qaiya-cai” and if you want to add <em>Series #1 The Magician</em>, use the canister id “cwu5z-wyaaa-aaaaj-qaoaq-cai.”</p><h3>“I Still Can’t See It!”</h3><p>Well, Stoic Wallet has another quirk. If tokens that you manually added to the wallet don’t show up, try this.</p><p>Click your ICP Balance:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/416/1*Tq6fHjy8GiK58PH-OjnDJg.png" /></figure><p>Then Click your NFT Balance:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/404/1*di3yuk6M4yRn7dDL3_19-Q.png" /></figure><p>Your NFT(s) should now be visible.</p><h3>“Wow, That’s Difficult…”</h3><p>Yes it is! Our project also supports the <a href="http://plugwallet.ooo">Plug wallet</a>, which doesn’t experience any of these issues. Solutions to these bugs are already complete, we are just waiting on Toniq Labs to accept them.</p><h3>“Why Do I Even Need To Do This?”</h3><p>Currently NFT projects often need to work one-on-one with wallet projects to make their NFTs “auto discover” in each wallet. The work itself is very simple, but it requires lots of coordination, review, and duplicate work for developers on both sides of the equation. A better approach would be to have a community owned service (or maybe several services) that can tackle this work. Psychedelic DAO has already released a project that’s a great start: <a href="https://dab.ooo/">DAB</a>. If we can coordinate the community around projects like that DAB, we can fix problems like having to manually punch in funny strings to work with our NFTs 😊</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Stoic Wallet is working on integrating DAB, so that this step won’t be necessary. Unfortunately it is not complete yet as of this writing.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=60a93b4585cb" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://posts.saga.cards/manually-adding-nfts-to-your-stoic-wallet-60a93b4585cb">Manually Adding NFTs to Your Stoic Wallet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://posts.saga.cards">Saga Cards</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s everything you need to know about the sale and these NFTs that you do not want to miss. ❤️</p><h3><strong>Public Sale Details</strong></h3><p>The sale will begin on Friday December 10th, and you’ll need to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/sagacards">@SagaCards</a> on Twitter to be notified of the start time. Supply will be limited to 117 NFTs, with 100 available during the public sale. Each mint will cost 2 ICP.</p><p>This is the first of 22 releases: one for each of the Major Arcana in a traditional tarot deck. These releases will happen regularly, once every two or three weeks.</p><p>When the time comes, the public sale will be available from <a href="https://legends.saga.cards/">our home page</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oqYlZ2NeL1rzDLlcudHaxg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Each release features art from Saga’s first official Tarot deck with rarity based card trim.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Legends NFTS</strong></h3><p>Saga Legends is an innovative project that imaginatively pushes the boundaries of NFTs, strongly enabled by the Internet Computer blockchain. 💪</p><p>Here are some of the standout features of every Legend NFT:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*IZMYk4s7_3U64tycvVi0EA.gif" /></figure><p>👻<br>Can be viewed in three ways: as <a href="https://nges7-giaaa-aaaaj-qaiya-cai.raw.ic0.app/0">an interactive 3D object</a>, as <a href="https://nges7-giaaa-aaaaj-qaiya-cai.raw.ic0.app/0.webp">a static image</a>, and <a href="https://nges7-giaaa-aaaaj-qaiya-cai.raw.ic0.app/0.webm">as an animation</a>.</p><p>👷<br>Has <a href="https://nges7-giaaa-aaaaj-qaiya-cai.raw.ic0.app/legend-manifest/0/">a manifest</a> that developers can use to bring the object into any 3D application.</p><p>🔗<br>Encoded directly onchain: one canister (smart contract) maintains all assets, plus records of ownership, transactions, etc.</p><h3><strong>Holder Benefits</strong></h3><p>We are always looking for the best way to make this project an engaging and rewarding place for you to spend your valuable attention and $ICP. 🙏</p><p><strong>Community Coffer Allocation: </strong>A portion of sales will be allocated to a community coffer that holders will be able to vote on to put towards different initiatives. This includes proceeds from this week’s sale.</p><p><em>Previously this article indicated that there would be a revenue share for holders. While we have the tech do to this, we have been advised that now is not the time. The community coffer replaces this feature. 🙏</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BAskIMuzCJ47rKE7PSzMkg.png" /><figcaption>Percentages shown here are not final and are subject to change.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note: marketplace integration is mostly complete as of this writing, but our marketplace partners are still in development. Marketplaces will be ready in 1–2 months.</em></p><p><strong>Deck Crafting: </strong>Every Legend NFT will have a number of forge slots, which allow you to craft a complete tarot deck with the unique card back and border of your legend. Use the deck in dApps, or sell it on the marketplace. (It will be several months before this feature is available.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N60eQJfJFN1k2U0kRfPq8A.png" /></figure><h3><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h3><p>We’re building Tarot in the Metaverse! Saga is hard at work on our first tarot deck, and several fun dApps for you to use them in. We are committed to building an open and decentralized tarot ecosystem together with the tarot and web3 communities.</p><p>Thanks for tuning in!

It’s a small launch by some standards, but I’m extremely grateful for this reception, very proud of the work that contributors put in, and so excited to iterate and move on to the next release with all of you!</p><h3><strong>The Next Public Sale</strong></h3><p>You can now preview the next Legend, <em>The Magician</em>, on <a href="https://legends.saga.cards/">the legends homepage</a>. This release will happen in January 2022, but the exact date is not yet determined. We intend to use each subsequent release as an opportunity to improve upon the last, so let’s preview some of what we aim to do better with the release of <em>The Magician</em>.</p><p><strong>More Card Trim Variety</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C1HIIjiXMjRAvwvsUpG-qA.png" /><figcaption>Concept sketches of new card trims for the upcoming release.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thesaxonstoryteller/">The Saxon Story Teller</a> is creating new card backs and borders that will add more variety to <em>The Magician</em>, and provide collectors with the ability to craft more unique tarot card decks with the Deck Crafting feature in the future. Some of these trims will be exclusive to this release, and some will also be available in future releases.</p><p><strong>Better Transactions Technology</strong></p><p>Based on our experience with the first public sale, we’ve identified some technical objectives that will reduce the need for refunds. Transaction technology on the Internet Computer blockchain is in early days, and there should be some very significant improvements that we can make for later releases.</p><p><strong>Pre-Sale Event</strong></p><p>We will be holding a limited access pre-sale before the public sale for <em>The Magician</em>. Access to the pre-sale for <em>The Magician </em>will be granted to the following groups (the exact numbers here are subject to some change):</p><ul><li>Randomly selected holders of the first mint (~5.)</li><li>The most engaged users in our upcoming discord community (~5.)</li><li>Everyone who had to be refunded in the first public sale (~15.)</li><li>Community contributors (~15.)</li></ul><p>We are also working with some collaborators to develop pre-sale tickets as NFTs. There’s a chance that these tickets are ready for <em>The Magician’s </em>release, but no promises! These pre-sale tickets should add some fun network effects to future releases.</p><h3><strong>Community Coffer Update</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxIcZt-WI_aXCPLqn20GkA.jpeg" /></figure><p><a href="https://www.dfinityexplorer.org/#/tx/88e862cc720abe102e1ccf8f183f9dea10c0d2b21a98c1500dab98af577479f0">10% of the proceeds from the first public sale were allocated to the community coffer</a>. The goal of this fund is to share the profits with holders based on the value that those holders are providing to the project. What we want to avoid is behaving like a security. In my view, trading Legends, talking about Legends, and providing feedback on Legends are all added value (and that’s not an exhaustive list). Based on that, I’m hopeful that we will find a mechanism to reward the majority of holders who are not just silently speculating on Legends NFTs.</p><p>Ideally, this is something that holders will take time to contribute ideas toward. To that end, we will dedicate a chat room to this topic in the community Discord.</p><h3><strong>Discord Community</strong></h3><p>A discord is in the works now! We are getting some help from the folks that set up the Poked Bots discord, and they tell me that the discord will be ready before Christmas. I’m currently planning out roles for moderators and some fun events and perks for the discord community.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*M10eXeTjZVlDLwhdRYn7NQ.png" /><figcaption>The Disk of Legends!</figcaption></figure><h3>The Disk of Legends</h3><p>If you’ve read the Legends project homepage, you’ll be familiar with the DoL, and you may wonder where yours is!</p><p>The first version will be ready in early January, and more features will be added at a later date.</p><p>For each legend that you mint, a rune will be added to your disk. For now, you will be able to use your disk as a social avatar to flex your status as a Saga supporter, and in the future it will unlock powerful features such as Deck Crafting.</p><h3><strong>Marketplace Update</strong></h3><p>Listing Legends on a marketplace is a top priority for us, and we’re happy to say that Entrepot has reached out to assist with integrating their marketplace. My goal is to get this feature ready before the release of <em>The Magician.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6h7GjtW7yOQS4nGiZ-iAaw.png" /></figure><p>Thanks for stopping by for this update!
